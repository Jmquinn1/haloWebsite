    <p>Here is a list of quotes about products</p>
    <ul>
        <li><q cite="https://smei.org/blog/famous-35-quotes-product/">Any product that needs a manual to work is
            broken.</q>
        </li>
        <li><q cite="https://smei.org/blog/famous-35-quotes-product/">Quality in a product or service is not what the
            supplier puts in. it is what the customer gets out and is willing to pay for. A product is not quality
            because
            it is hard to make and costs a lot of money, as manufacturers typically believe.</q></li>
        <li><q cite="https://smei.org/blog/famous-35-quotes-product/">A product is something made in a factory; a brand
            is
            something that is bought by the customer. A product can be copied by a competitor; a brand is unique. A
            product
            can be quickly outdated; a successful brand is timeless.</q></li>
